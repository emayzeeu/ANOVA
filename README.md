## ANOVA Testing
In this portfolio project, we analyze a dataset containing information on product sales across different countries. The dataset includes variables such as product category, country of sale, and the number of items sold. The primary objective of this project is to investigate whether there are significant differences in the number of items sold based on product category and country of sale. To achieve this, we employ exploratory data analysis, one-way and two-way ANOVA tests, and post hoc analysis. The findings may provide valuable insights into the factors influencing sales performance and contribute to better decision-making in marketing and sales strategies. <br>
